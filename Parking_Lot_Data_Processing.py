def parking_lot_setup_for_main(N_REL_CLASSES, VERBOSE_FLAGS, seed):
    """
    Load the raw Parking Lot dataset and return everything in the exact format
    expected by A/RED, including dynamically choosing the N_REL_CLASSES rarest
    classes as "relevant".

    This now mirrors the behavior of MNIST_setup_for_main().

    Parameters
    ----------
    N_REL_CLASSES : int
        Number of rarest classes to mark as "relevant" (anomalies of interest).
    VERBOSE_FLAGS : list of int
        Used for optional printing (0 = basic info).
    seed : int
        Random seed (currently not used for sampling, but kept for API consistency).

    Returns
    -------
    X                : np.ndarray, (n_samples, 16384)  [128×128 flattened grayscale]
    y_w_rel          : list of (label_str, is_relevant_bool)
    sparsity_levels  : list of (label, proportion) sorted from most → least common
    relevant_labels  : list of str  (the N rarest classes)
